His research interests include information retrieval, text classification, question answer, knowledge graph, machine translation. He always considers how to use knowledge graph and deep neural network (CNN, LSTM, attention, transformer, etc) to sovle the problems about NLP. You can learn his work in Part "research". He is a sunshine boy! In daily life, he likes cooking, climbing, basketball. He has a  motto: "I will never give up, even if there is only little hope." Becauce he does it all the time!
